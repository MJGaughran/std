<h1 align="center">std Release Notes</h1>

<h2 align="center">Release 2-3</h2>

<p align="left">This is what's left of the synApps std module
after the modules autosave, calc, optics, sscan, and vme were split out.
</p>

This version is intended to build with EPICS base 3.14.5.

Differences from std 2.2:
<ul>
<li><p>scaler record - device support that used "struct callback" defined
in devScaler.h must now replace that with "CALLBACK", and must include
epics/base/include/callback.h
<li>sseq record - Now allows user to specify whether or not the record
should wait, after putting a link value, for the resulting processing to
complete before processing the next link.  Some code cleanup.  Added
seqRecDebug.
<li>topDAC8.adl - Deleted to avoid conflict with dac128V module.
<li>VXstats_full.adl
<li>pid_control_settings.req - added delta time
<li>Added device-independent scaler database and save-restore settings files.
<li>timeString.db - new capability in 3.14.5: stringin record can get time date.
</ul>
