<h1 align="center">std Release Notes</h1>

<h2 align="center">Release 2-5-2</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>sseqRecord.html rewritten.  The old version was a minimal modification
of seqRecord.html, from the EPICS Record Reference Manual, and was not
very clear.

<li><p>scaler record: v3.18: Don't post CNT field unless record-support changed its
value.  Modified debug macro.

<li><p>devEpidFast.c: changed strtok_r to epicsStrtok_r

<li><p>pvHistory: new software to maintain short-term history of a few PV's in
the ioc.  Software comprises pvHistory.c (genSub routines), devTimeOfDay.c,
pvHistory.db, pvHistory.req (autosave-request file), and pvHistory*.adl, and
relies on autosave to save/restore the value arrays.

<li><p>softMotor.db: shortened some .DESC field values so they fit.

<li><p>all_com_4.db: new file

<li><p>softMotorConfig.adl: related-display callups were using sCalcout files for
calcout records, because synApps did not contain calcout medm displays.  Now the
calc module does contain calcout displays, so we use them.

</ul>

<h2 align="center">Release 2-4</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>mpf-related stuff replaced by asyn-related stuff
<li><p>minor scaler-record changes to accommodate Joerger VS series.  Existing
support for other scaler devices should not require any modifications.
<li><p>BitBus is no longer supported
<li><p>ioc-status info now provided by vxStats module
<li><p>PID support rearranged around the asyn module
<li><p>SSEQ-record delays now snap to nearest clock period, and show user the
delay that will actually be used.  Fixed bug that was crashing on Linux and
Windows.
<li><p><a href="cvsLog.txt">cvs log</a>
</ul>

<h2 align="center">Release 2-3</h2>

<p align="left">This is what's left of the synApps std module
after the modules autosave, calc, optics, sscan, and vme were split out.
</p>

This version is intended to build with EPICS base 3.14.5.

Differences from std 2.2:
<ul>
<li><p>scaler record - device support that used "struct callback" defined
in devScaler.h must now replace that with "CALLBACK", and must include
epics/base/include/callback.h
<li>sseq record - Now allows user to specify whether or not the record
should wait, after putting a link value, for the resulting processing to
complete before processing the next link.  Some code cleanup.  Added
seqRecDebug.
<li>topDAC8.adl - Deleted to avoid conflict with dac128V module.
<li>VXstats_full.adl
<li>pid_control_settings.req - added delta time
<li>Added device-independent scaler database and save-restore settings files.
<li>timeString.db - new capability in 3.14.5: stringin record can get time date.
</ul>
