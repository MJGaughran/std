<hr>

<p>The EPID record is used to maintain a setpoint that affects
the output according to the difference between a controlled value
and the setpoint. It provides EPICS with a very flexible and
powerful tool for peforming feedback. The EPID record is an
Enhanced version of the EPICS PID record. The major improvements
in the EPID record compared to the PID record include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Separation of device support from the record. There is
        Soft Record device support which uses EPICS database
        links, and this is very similar to the PID record.
        However, the EPID record can also be used with other
        device support, for example to communicate with faster
        feedback software, or with hardware controllers. Device
        support is provided in the Message Passing Facility for
        fast feedback (&gt; 1 kHz) using an Acromag IP330 ADC and
        a Systran DAC128V DAC.</li>
    <li>Addition of many fields (OUTL, DRVH, DRVL) to simplify
        construction of databases</li>
    <li>The PID expression is computed as an absolute number,
        rather than a differential number to be added to the
        present output value. This simplifies database
        construction, and also permits the record itself to
        perform limit checking on the output.</li>
    <li>Limits are placed on the magnitude of the integral term
        (I) which are lacking in the PID record.</li>
    <li>Monitors are posted for the CVAL field, which simplifies
        construction of user-interface tools, such as plotting.</li>
    <li>The CVL field has been renamed INP. This field can now be
        modified (a feature of EPICS R3.12 and higher), so that a
        single EPID record can be used to control different
        processes at different times.</li>
    <li>Changed the time units of the KI and KD terms from
        minutes to seconds</li>
</ul>

<p>Each time the record is processed the setpoint is read and
then the <tt>do_pid()</tt> function in device support is called.
The Soft Record device support reads the controlled value,
computes the PID expression and, if feedback is enabled, writes
its output to the output link.</p>

<p>There are three terms of the PID expression: the proportional,
the integral, and the derivative. Using the gain that exists for
each of these terms, the user can weight each contribution
according to the characteristics of the controlled variable.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="Scan Parameters">Scan Parameters</a></h2>

<hr>

<p>The PID record has the standard fields (SCAN, etc.) for
specifying under what circumstances it will be processed. The
minimum delta time field (MDT) is a processing field particular
to the PID record. It can be configured by the user or modified
at run-time. It contains a floating point value which represents
the minimum amount of time between record processing. The actual
meaning of the SCAN and MDT fields depends upon which device
support is used:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Soft Record device support. The SCAN field controls the
        rate at which the feedback calculation is actually
        performed. The maximum rate is typically 10 Hz. If the
        amount of time between the last time the record was
        processed an the current time is less than MDT, than the
        record is not processed. If MDT is left at its default
        value (0), the minimum delta will be equal to one clock
        tick. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>MPF Ip330PID device support. The SCAN field controls the
        rate at which new parameters (KP, KI, KD, VAL, etc.) are
        sent to the Ip330PID server, and the rate at which the
        current feedback parameters (P, I, D, CVAL, etc.) are
        read back from the server and displayed. Thus the SCAN
        field controls the rate at which the EPID record takes
        &quot;snapshots&quot; of the feedback processing running
        on the MPF server. The feedback itself can actually be
        running much faster, i.e. 1 kHz or more. The MDT field is
        ignorred by this device support. The DT field is used to
        control the time per feedback loop on the MPF server. The
        DT field is also modified by the device support to
        reflect the actual time per feedback loop, since this may
        differ from the requested time.</li>

<p>The meaning of the INP field depends upon what device support
is used:</p>

<menu>
    <li>Soft Record device support. The input link field (INP) is
        used to obtain the value of the controlled process
        variable, i.e., the value read into the CVAL field. The
        link must be a database link. If it is not a database
        link a MAJOR alarm is triggered when the record is
        processed. The INP field <em>can</em> be modified at
        run-time.</li>
</menu>

<menu>
    <li>MPF Ip330PID device support. The input link field (INP)
        is used to specify the location of the MPF Ip330PID
        server which actually performs the feedback. The Ip330PID
        server is configured in the vxWorks MPF server startup
        file to specify which Ip330 ADC channel is used as the
        input from which the value is read into the CVAL field.
        The link must be a VME link, and <em>cannot</em> be
        modified at run-time.</li>

<hr>

<p>The setpoint mode select (SMSL) and the setpoint location
(STPL) fields determine where the setpoint value is obtained,
which is held in the VAL field. The SMSL and STPL fields work
just like the OMSL and DOL fields found in many output records
(analog output, binary output, etc.).</p>

<p>The SMSL field has two choices: <code>supervisory</code> and 
<code>closed_loop</code>.
When <code>supervisory</code>, the setpoint, i.e., VAL, can be
set via database access. When <code>closed_loop</code>, the
setpoint value is retrieved from the link specified in STPL,
which must be a database link. STML can also be a constant in
which case VAL is set equal to the constant value when the record
is initialized, and the value can be modified at run-time via
database access or channel access.</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="Output parameters">Output parameters</a></h2>

<hr>

<p>There are two fields which control the output of the EPID
record, FBON (Feedback On) and OUTL (Output Link). The meanings
of the these fields depends upon what device support is used:</p>

<menu>
    <li>Soft Record device support. The output link field (OUTL)
        is used to control where the computed output (OVAL) is
        sent. If OUTL is a database link and if FBON=1 then the
        output value (OVAL) is written to this link each time the
        record processes. If FBON=0, or if OUTL is not a database
        link then the device support still computes the OVAL but
        does not write OVAL to the output link.</li>
</menu>

<menu>
    <li>MPF Ip330PID device support. The output link field (OUTL)
        is not used. Rather, the Ip330PID server is configured in
        the vxWorks MPF server startup file to specify which
        DAC128V DAC channel is used as the output. If FBON=1 then
        the computed output will be written to the DAC channel
        each time the feedback loop executes. The execution of
        the feedback loop is independent of, and typically much
        faster than the rate at which the EPID record processes.
        If FBON=0 then the feedback loop still executes, but it
        does not write the output to the DAC channel.</li>

<p>The discrete from of the PID expression is as follows:</p>

<p>M(n) = P + I + D</p>

<p>P = KP * E(n)</p>

<p>I = KP * KI * SUMi ( E(i) * dT(n) )</p>

<p>D = KP * KD * ( (E(n) - (E(n-1) ) / dT(n) )</p>

<p>where</p>

<dl>
    <dd>M(n) = value of manipulated variable at <em>n</em>th
        instant.</dd>
    <dd>P = Proportional term</dd>
    <dd>I = Integral term</dd>
    <dd>D = Derivative term</dd>
    <dd>KP = Proportional gain</dd>
    <dd>KI = Integral gain</dd>
    <dd>KD = Derivative gain</dd>
    <dd>E(n) = Error at nth sampling instant</dd>
    <dd>SUMi = Sum from i=0 to i=n</dd>
    <dd>dT(n) = Time difference between n-1 instance and nth
        instance</dd>
</dl>

<p>The terms KP, KI, and KD are the only terms configured by the
user. These terms represent the gain for the proportional (KP),
integral (KI) and the derivative (KD) terms. A field exists for
each of these terms (the KP, KI, and KD fields). KP should be
configured according to the characteristics of the controlled
variable; KI should be set equal to the number of times per
second that the integral contribution repeats the proportional
contribution; and KD should equal the number of seconds until the
derivative contribution repeats the proportional contribution.
See the<a href="#Feedback Tuning"> guide to feedback tuning</a>
below for more information on setting KP, KI and KD.</p>

<p>The PID device support calculates the other terms of the
expression. The Soft Record and MPF Ip330PID device support both
calculate these as follows:</p>

<dl>
    <dt>E(n)</dt>
    <dd>Error at nth sampling instant, where the Error equals the
        setpoint minus the value of the controlled variable (VAL
        - CVAL). The ERR field in the record holds this value.</dd>
    <dt>P</dt>
    <dd>Proportional term, calculated from the above equation.
        The P field in the record holds this value.</dd>
    <dt>I</dt>
    <dd>Integral term, calculated from the above equation. The I
        field in the record holds this value. Note that the
        integral term is a sum from time=0 to the present time,
        and hence can grow extremely large if not subject to some
        &quot;sanity checks&quot;. The EPICS PID record does not
        perform any such checks, which is a serious limitation.
        The EPID record device support performs the following
        checks to prevent the integral term from growing too
        large when feedback is not working correctly:</dd>
</dl>

<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>I is not allowed to increase if the computed output, M(n), is at
            the high limit, DRVH.</li>
        <li>I is now allowed to decrease if the computed output, M(n), is at
            the low limit, DRVL.</li>
        <li>I is not allowed to be less than DRVL or greater than
            DRVH.</li>
        <li>If KI is zero then I is set to zero. This allows
            &quot;clearing&quot; the integral term by setting KI
            to zero.</li>
        <li>I can be modified from database access or channel
            access. This allows the user to set I to a specific
            value to improve response time, rather than waiting
            for the normal time constant associated with this
            term.</li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

<dl>
    <dt>D</dt>
    <dd>Derivative term. The D field in the record holds this
        value.</dd>
    <dt>M(n)</dt>
    <dd>This is the end result of the PID expression--the change
        in the manipulated value, which is the desired output.
        The OVAL field holds this value. However, OVAL is first
        limited to be no smaller than DRVL and no larger than
        DRVH.</dd>
    <dt>dT(n)</dt>
    <dd>This is the time difference between n and n-1, between
        current and last samplings. It is stored in the DT field.
        For the Soft Record device support this field is
        Read-Only. For the MPF Ip330PID device support this field
        can be modified to control the time per feedback loop.</dd>

        For example if controlling a heater power supply with a
        DAC which has 10 Watt/volt response, and the heater
        response is 10 degrees/Watt, then KP=.01 volts/degree.</p>

        changes in the setpoint (VAL) and observe the system
        response. Don't worry about system droop (CVAL != VAL),
        since this is unavoidable when KI=0. Rather look for
        oscillations and instability. Gradually increase KP while
        making changes in the setpoint. When KP is too large the
        system will begin to oscillate. Decrease KP until the

        the time constant of the system and the update rate of
        the feedback loop. Increase KI until the system responds
        as rapidly as possible to changes in the setpoint without
        overshoot or oscillation.</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="Operator Display Parameters">Operator
Display Parameters</a></h2>

<hr>

<p>These parameters are used to present meaningful data to the
operator. They display the setpoint (VAL), the controlled
variable (CVAL), the output value (OVAL), and other fields of the
EPID, either textually or graphically.</p>

<p>EGU is a string of up to 16 characters describing the units of
PID's manipulated values measures. It is retrieved by the 
<code>get_units</code>
record support routine. It must be configured by the user if at
all.</p>

<p>The HOPR and LOPR fields set the upper and lower display
limits for the VAL, CVAL, HIHI, HIGH, LOW, and LOLO fields.</p>

<p>The DRVH and DRVL fields set the upper and lower display
limits for the OVAL, P, I, and D fields.</p>

<p>The PREC field determines the floating point precision with
which to display VAL and CVAL. It is used whenever the 
<code>get_precision</code>
record support routine is called.</p>

Parameters</a></h2>

<p>These parameters are used to determine when to send monitors
placed on the VAL field. These fields contain values configured
by the user. The monitors are sent when the VAL field exceeds the
last monitored field (MLST, ALST, and LALM) by the appropriate
delta. Otherwise, value change monitors are not called. If these
fields have a value of zero, everytime the value changes, a
monitor will be triggered; if they have a value of -1, everytime
the record is processed, monitors are triggered. The ADEL field
is the delta used for archive monitors, and the MDEL field is the
delta for all other types of monitors.</p>

<p>The ODEL field specifies the hysteresis factor for the OVAL
field, the field which holds the manipulated value. Unless the
current value of OVAL is greater than the amount which the user
specifies in this field, no monitors will be invoked. If zero,
anytime OVAL is greater than zero, a monitor is triggered. If -1,
each time the record is processed, a monitor is triggered. Note
that when monitors are called for OVAL, they are also called for
the following fields which comprise the PID expression: P, I, D,
CT, DT, ERR, and DERR.</p>
