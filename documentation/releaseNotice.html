<h2>
Release 1-3</h2>
<ul>
  <li>XIA_shutter.db - Added records that open and close the shutter by writing
string commands, rather than requiring the client to write the strings.&nbsp;
This allows the shutter to be controlled directly by the sscan record, which
cannot write strings.</li>
  <li>hrSeq.db - v 3.2 modified to support non-nested dispersive double crystal geometry.</li>
  <li>scan.db - Added MAXPTSH macro, saveData_comment1, and saveData_comment2. &nbsp;Added scanActive calc.&nbsp; Deleted default detectors and triggers.</li>
  <li>userAve10.db - add restart, one-shot support, report current sample.</li>
  <li>XIA_shutter.adl - XIA_shutter_more.adl - XIA_shutter_small.adl - Changed buttons that open and close the shutter so that they process
records that write string commands, rather than writing the string commands
directly.&nbsp; This allows the shutter to be controlled directly by the
sscan record, which cannot write strings.</li>
  <li>hrSeqCtl_All.adl - Added selector for geometry (nested/symmetric).</li>
  <li>scan.adl - scan_detectors10.adl - scan_detectorsOld.adl - scan_more.adl
-scan_positioners.adl - dynLink status (e.g., red X's) no longer shows when
no PV has been entered (requires MEDM v2.3.6 or later).</li>
  <li>table_setup_GEOCARS.adl - table_setup_NEWPORT.adl - table_setup_PNC.adl
- table_setup_SRI.adl - RZ field wasn't being displayed for some reason.</li>
  <li>userAve.adl - Added one-shot/continuous, restart, current sample.</li>
  <li>dbrestore.c -save_restore.c - fGetDateStr.c added -fGetDateStr.h added
- V2.7; Added include-file and macro-substitution capabilities.&nbsp; Added
Frank Lenkszus' modifications (file path, set_passN_restoreFile, reload save
sets, etc.)</li>
  <li>hrCtl.st - Added symmetric geometry, fixed phi2 init, phi offsets recalculated
on transition into Set mode, Set mode no longer wipes world offsets.</li>
  <li>initHooks.c - Modified to support V2.7 dbrestore.c; add support to restore from a list of save files.</li>
  <li>sCalcPerform.c - sCalcPostfix.c - sCalcPostfixPvt.h - Added BYTE operator.</li>
  <li>saveData.c - v1.13 Trigger PV now retains field name; realTime1D was
treated as int, instead of short, so it seemed to be on at boot; null terminate
DBR_STRING, so string variables behave right.</li>
  <li>subAve.c - limit number of samples to average, reset restart field (.A), report current sample number (.E).</li>
  <li>transformRecord.c - transformRecord.html - v 5.4; New way to determine
if a value should be recalculated: if not same as old value and if not marked
in bitmap.&nbsp; Bitmap is marked if value is written to unless PACT was
true at the time.&nbsp; New debug calc prints info with lower value of transformRecordDebug
if TPRO is true.</li>
</ul>
